              I always enjoyed the ease-of-use of Apple&trade;'s AirDropÂ®, however, most of the time, I am not transferring files between Apple devices.

            <ProjectParagraph>
              That was my motivation to create blymp.<br />
              blymp is a simple website that you can use to directly transfer files between devices using a simple 4-digit code.

              Fast transfer speeds
            </ProjectHeading>
            blymp tries to use the fastest transfer speeds possible.<br />
            In order to do this, blymp tries to establish a Peer-to-Peer connection using WebRTC with which files can be transferred without the need of a server.<br />
            If that is however not possible, blymp will use WebSockets to transfer the file using the blymp server.

              Transfer using packages
            </ProjectHeading>
            When transferring files using other upload services, you'll first need to upload your complete file before you can download it on the other device.<br />
            blymp instead breaks the file into small packages and directly transfers them to the recepient - resulting in higher transfer speeds.

          <h2>What I've learned</h2>
          <p>
            blymp is my first project, in which I used a Peer-to-Peer connection to connect devices and in which I used the JavaScript FileReader API to slowly read files in chunks.<br />
            It was very interesting to develop this webapp in a way that doesn't rely on a central server when transferring files using WebRTC but instead directly establishing a protocol between individual users.
